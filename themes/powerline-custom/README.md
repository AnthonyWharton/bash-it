# Powerline Custom Theme

Custom Powerline theme that is essentially a rebuilt
`powerline`/`powerline-multiline` theme with a few custom additions. These are
namely:

 - [ ] **Better colour control;** Ensure proper support for foreground and
       background colours in all powerline segments, including text effects
       (e.g. bold text)
 - [ ] **Newly designed command line;** with a more colourful prompt and
       prettier last command status display.
 - [ ] **Fixed prompt width;** The width used to break when in a git-repo and
       become narrower than the terminal width.
 - [ ] *Add future changes/ideas here...*
